  Many real-world graphs, in particular social networks, exhibit clustering and are hypothesized to possess an underlying geometrical generative structure.
  The Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRG) model is one proposed generative geometric model. This thesis demonstrates the proficiency of assorted GIRG variants in generating graphs that resemble a dataset of real social network graphs across a spectrum of high-level graph features.
  We then investigate practical methods of fitting GIRG node geometric location parameters to a given input graph. Using these, we show that low-dimensional GIRGs can successfully replicate our social network graphs on a node and edge level. Throughout this thesis, we aim to offer guidance on generating and fitting different types of GIRGs, as well as an intuitive understanding of the GIRG model.
